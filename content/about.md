Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art and combat sport which focuses on ground fighting to control and submit your opponent. It is the product of the introduction of Japanese jiu jitsu and judo to Brazil in the early 1900s, where it was transformed into a new style by a core group of Brazilian pioneers - most famously the Gracie family, who can trace their ancestry back to George Gracie of Dumfries wo left for Brazil in 1826.

BJJ can be trained in the gi (traditional jacket and trousers) or no-gi (regular sports clothing) with slightly different rules. At NRBJJ, we train in both.

It has recently grown in popularity partly due to MMA and the UFC, which was founded to identify the most effective art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different disciplines.

BJJ offers a wide range of benefits, including: improved physical fitness through increased strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular health; stress reduction; boosted confidence; and enhanced problem solving skills, all while fostering a sense of community through training with others. It provides a holistic workout for both body and mind.

### Your first session

You're welcome to train with NRBJJ for a free trial class. Please [contact us](mailto:nithriverbjj@gmail.com) to arrange this. Groups can also arrange a private trial class outwith our regular timetabled sessions if more convenient.

We'd recommend wearing comfortable sports clothing (shorts and t-shirt), and consider bringing a gumshield if you have one. Bringing water is a good idea too, and a pair of sliders or sandals for walking off the mat are also useful.

You'll need to ensure you've [completed our Waiver](https://nithriverbjj.com/waiver) before stepping onto the mat to train.

Our BJJ club is not as traditional or formal as other martial arts can be, but one specific rule we share with many other BJJ teams which might not be obvious to newcomers to the sport is in **respecting our mats**:
* Do not step on the mat with shoes on,
* Do not step barefoot off the mat before returning to the mat (sliders or sandals are recommended)

Keeping our mat space clean is paramount for maintaining our team's ability to train, so please ensure you abide by the above rules.
